     ```

2. **Data Loading:**  
   - The Titanic dataset is loaded from the Seaborn library.  
   - Initial exploration of dataset structure and feature details.  

3. **Data Cleaning:**  
   - Handle missing values.  
   - Convert data types if required.  
   - Drop irrelevant or unnecessary columns.  

4. **Data Exploration:**  
   - Summarize statistical properties.  
   - Examine correlations between features.  
   - Analyze distributions and categorical features.  

5. **Data Visualization:**  
   - Visualize survival distribution based on gender, class, and age.  
   - Plot correlation heatmap to understand relationships.  
   - Analyze survival rates for different passenger classes.

## 🔍 Key Insights and Observations
- **Gender Impact:** Female passengers had a higher survival rate than males.  
- **Class Influence:** Passengers in **1st class** had a better survival rate.  
- **Age Factor:** Younger passengers tended to survive more.  
- **Fare Correlation:** Higher fare prices were associated with better survival chances.
